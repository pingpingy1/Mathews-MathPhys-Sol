\begin{align*}
    \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{x^{n + 1}}{n + 1} P_n(x)
    &= \int_0^x dh \left(
        \sum_{n = 0}^\infty h^n P_n(x)
    \right) \\
    &= \int_0^x \frac{dh}{\sqrt{1 - 2hx + h^2}} \\
    &= \diffBetween{-\ln\left(
        \sqrt{1 - 2hx + h^2} + x - h
    \right)}{h = 0}{h = x} \\
    &= \ln\left( \frac{1 + x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right)
\end{align*}

Of course, the integral formulation restricts $x$ such that $\abs{x} < 1$.
It seems likely that the domain of convergence is this disc (plus some boundary points).
As evidence, I point out that $x = 1$ yields the harmonic series.
If anyone could find the domain of convergence, it would be greatly appreciated!
