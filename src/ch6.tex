\paragraph{Note of Warning}
Simply stating the answers to problems such as these have zero value,
as they can be found with one query to the almighty WolframAlpha immediately.
Hence, this manual is dedicated to a more proof-of-effort style of solution,
where every nitty gritty detail is to be written.
Proceed with caution.
