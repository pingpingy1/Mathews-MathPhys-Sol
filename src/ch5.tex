\paragraph{Note of Warning}
To be perfectly candid, I kind of hate solutions that use a wholly unmotivated conformal mapping,
since they feel more like things to memorize than a skill I can train and apply to other problems.
I will try to provide as much motivation as possible, but please keep this mindset of mine in mind.
