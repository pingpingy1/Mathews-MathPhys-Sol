\item
For simplicity, we shall assume that $f(z)$ has no poles exactly on any of the real integers.
(In fact, I am not sure if this procedure could even be done with them!)
Let us denote the poles of $f(z)$ off of the real axis as $\zoff{i}$
and those on the real axis as $\zon{i}$.
(Of course, we are also assuming that $f(z)$ only has isolated singularities on the entire plane.
Note that this is a tiny bit more general than
\urlfoot{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meromorphic_function}{meromorphic functions},
since we allow the singularities to be essential, not poles.
We just need them to be discrete, i.e., no cluster points.)

We first consider the contour $C_1$ in \reffig{}~\ref{fig:problem3-31} to obtain
\begin{align*}
    \oint_{C_1} dz f(z) \cot \pi z
    &= 2i\pi \sum_n \res{z=n}{f(z) \cot \pi z} + 2i\pi \sum_i \res{z=\zon{i}}{f(z) \cot \pi z} \\
    &= 2i\pi \sum_n \evalAt{\frac{f(z) \cos \pi z}{\pi \cos \pi z}}{z=n}
     + 2i\pi \sum_i \res{z=\zon{i}}{f(z) \cot \pi z} \\
    &=: 2i \sum_n f(n) + 2i\pi \sum_i \Ron{i}
\end{align*}
where $\Ron{i} := \res{z=\zon{i}}{f(z) \cot \pi z}$.
Similarly for $C_2$,
\[
    \oint_{C_2} dz f(z) \cot \pi z
    = 2i\pi \sum_i \res{z=\zoff{i}}{f(z) \cot \pi z}
    =: 2i \sum_n f(n) + 2i\pi \sum_i \Roff{i}
\]
where $\Roff{i} := \res{z=\zoff{i}}{f(z) \cot \pi z}$.

Now, following the exercise regarding \refeq{3}{43}, we note that
if $\abs{f(z)}$ vanishes sufficiently quickly\footnote{But what does this mean??!} as $z$ approaches infinity,
then
\[
    \oint_{C_1 + C_2} dz f(z) \cot \pi z \xrightarrow{R \rightarrow \infty} 0.
\]
\[
    \therefore \sum_n f(n)
    = -\pi \sum_i \Ron{i} - \pi \sum_i \Roff{i}
    = -\pi \sum_i R^{(i)}
\]
where we drop the subscript as the distinction between the two types of residues have disappeared.

(Note: One may be tempted to write
\[
    R^{(i)} = \cot \pi z^{(i)} \cdot \res{z=z^{(i)}}{f(z)}
\]
which may seem so since $\cot \pi z$ is analytic on a neighborhood of $z^{(i)}$;
goodness knows I fell for this.
However, if one considers the entire Laurent series, they can show that this is not the case.
In particular, if $z^{(i)}$ is a pole of $n$th order,
then the residue can be caluclated using the first $n$ Taylor coefficients of $\cot \pi z$ around $z^{(i)}$.
This means that this naive equation holds for simple poles, specifically!
See also: \urlfoot{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution}{Convolutions})

\item
Let $f(z) := \inv{z^2 + a^2}$. This function has simple poles at $\pm ia$.
We require that $ia$ not be an integer, as per the above discussion.
\[
    \res{z = \pm ia}{f(z)}
    = \evalAt{\frac{\cot \pi z}{z \pm ia}}{z = \pm ia}
    = \frac{\cot \pm i\pi a}{\pm 2ia}
    = -\inv{2a} \coth \pi a
\]
\[
    \therefore g(a)
    = -\pi \left( R_+ + R_- \right)
    = \frac{\pi}{a} \coth \pi a
\]
